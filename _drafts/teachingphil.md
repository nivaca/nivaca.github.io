During the last couple of years I have gradually moved from a teacher-centred approach to teaching to a student-centred one. I should admit that, at first, the move seemed to me to be somewhat unnatural, since most of my experience as a philosophy student—both in undergraduate and graduate levels—happened within the traditional lecture approach. And yet, in spite of its challenges, I have no doubt that it has been fairly rewarding, both for me and—so I hope—for my students.

Embracing a student-centred approach does not imply, of course, that lecturing is abandoned. It means, rather, that lecturing is placed at another level within the various class activities. Accordingly, I usually combine, in the same class, group workshops, short discussions, and short lectures. In these I tend to focus on explaning and illustrating the most difficult concepts and passages of the texts which have been assigned. Even though I assume from the outset that the students have already read the texts before entering the classroom, I usually give them a few minutes during the workshop sessions to direct them to particularly important passages and to allow them to reread them and discuss them with their peers.
