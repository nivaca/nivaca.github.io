I'm an Associate Professor at the [Department of Literature](http://literatura.uniandes.edu.co/), [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), Bogot√°, Colombia. My teaching and research interests concern classic and medieval works and authors from the Western (Latin) tradition. I'm an advocate of [digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) as well.

I'm also adjunct editor of the [Online Digital Edition of Wodeham's *Ordinatio*](https://scta.lombardpress.org/#/text?resourceid=http://scta.info/resource/b1-d3-qun), under the direction of Prof [Jeffrey C. Witt](http://jeffreycwitt.com/).

You can check out my Academia page [here](https://uniandes.academia.edu/NicolasVaughan).

I'm an enthusiast of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/), as well as of the document preparation system and markup language [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//). You may find some programmes and packages I have written in and for Python and LaTeX at my [gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/nivaca). I created this site with the static blogging platform [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using a nice theme by [Steve V. Miller](https://github.com/svmiller), and it is hosted as a [gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/pages/index.md).

I only use [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy) OS on my machines. Both at home and at the office I use [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org) with the powerful [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) desktop.
