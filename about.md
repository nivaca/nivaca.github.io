I'm Assistant Professor at the [Department of Philosophy](http://filosofia.uniandes.edu.co/), [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), Bogotá, Colombia. My current research interests include medieval semantics and medieval logical theories, centered particularly around the works of [William of Ockham](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/) and [Adam Wodeham](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wodeham/).
I am also adjunct editor of the [Online Digital Edition of Wodeham's *Ordinatio*](http://scta.lombardpress.org/text/questions/wodehamordinatio), under the direction of Prof [Jeffrey C. Witt](http://jeffreycwitt.com/). I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on—of course—medieval philosophy and medieval culture, as well as on argumentation theory, modern Empiricism and Kant.

You can check out my Academia page [here](https://uniandes.academia.edu/NicolasVaughan).

I'm an enthusiast of the [Python 3 programming language](https://www.python.org/), as well as of the document preparation system and markup language [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//). You may find some programmes and packages I have written in and for Python and LaTeX at my [github page](https://github.com/nivaca). I created this site with the static blogging platform [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using a nice theme by [Steve V. Miller](https://github.com/svmiller), and it is hosted as a [github page](https://pages.github.com/).

I only use [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy) OS on my machines. On my university PC, I have installed [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) (which is based upon [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) 16.04). At home, I have actually installed [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/) and [Antergos](https://antergos.com/), both with the powerful [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) desktop.

Finally, I'm also a double bass player, focused primarily on jazz repertory. You may find some videos of my jazz trio [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-JJLd-y77o2XB7NEwa9hbQ). (More coming soon!)
