I am an associate professor at the [Department of Humanities and Literature](http://literatura.uniandes.edu.co/), [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), Bogot√°, Colombia. My teaching and research interests concern classic and medieval works and authors from the Western (Latin) tradition. I'm an advocate of [digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) as well.


I have a PhD (DPhil) on Philosophy from Balliol College, University of Oxford, where I wrote a theses on the logic and semantics of the 14th-century philosopher [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham). 

I'm also adjunct editor of, and technical adviser to, the [Online Digital Edition of Wodeham's *Ordinatio*](https://scta.lombardpress.org/text?resourceid=http%3A%2F%2Fscta.info%2Fresource%2Fwodehamordinatio), under the direction of [Prof Jeffrey C. Witt](https://jeffreycwitt.com/).

You can check out my Academia page [here](https://uniandes.academia.edu/NicolasVaughan).

I'm an enthusiast of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/), as well as of the document preparation system and markup language [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//). 
You may find much of my technical stuff at my [GitHub](https://github.com/nivaca) page. 
I created this pages using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), with a theme by [S.V. Miller](http://svmiller.com/).
Its source code is available [here](https://github.com/nivaca/nivaca.github.io).

I exclusively use [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy) OS on my machines.
Currently I am happily on the [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) distribution with the [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) desktop.
For many years I used the [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org) distribution,  as well as (vanilla) [Arch Linux](https://getfedora.org/), but found them pretty unstable and hard to use on a daily basis.

I mostly use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) as my general editor (writing and coding), but frequently resort to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and [Oxygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/), depending on my needs.


As you can see I am an advocate of open source and open access software and publishing.
